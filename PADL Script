Program (compute sum) specification
  - simple two-participant calculator example

Demonstrate exploratory execution using GUI
  - show with 1, then more, clients around the same server.

Program (compute sum) implementations
  - naive, straightforward implementations.

Demonstrate real execution using WebSockets over mesh network

Produce a trace of actions using the simulator.

Tie the program to the specification with annotations.

Observe a decorated trace of actions.

Check the trace corresponds to the specification.
	
Confirm that erroneous implementations are rejected:
  - run client twice
  - make a mistake in the server implementation; e.g. compute product instead of sum

Observe that these are indeed single checked traces, not general reasoning: when sum and product coincide, it's fine.

Demonstrate QuickCheck to exorcise the error above.
